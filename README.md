# Project Overview

The domain search web app aims to address the challenge of simplifying the process of finding and securing domain names for individuals, businesses, and organizations. Many potential domain buyers struggle with navigating through various domain registrars, checking domain availability, and managing domain portfolios efficiently. 

## What it does
DomainFinderX is able to search for domain names by entering the name of the domain.
and then returns the availability and information of the provided domain.

## How I built it
DomainFinderX was built using HTML/CSS for the fronttend and python/Django for the backend.
The application takes domain name as input and returns the availability and information of any domain.

## What i learned
* Gained proficiency in using django for backend development and learned how to effectively  use its features such as URL routing, views and templates.
* Improved skills in HTML, CSS  for creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
* Learned how to integrate third-party APIs for domain information and handle API rate limits and errors.
